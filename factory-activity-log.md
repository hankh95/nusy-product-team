# Santiago Factory Activity Log

## November 19, 2025 - Daily Summary

### Factory Status: Operational (CI/CD Issues Resolved)

**Date:** November 19, 2025  
**Factory Status:** Ready for autonomous operation  
**CI/CD Pipeline:** Fixed and passing locally  

### Previous Night's Activity (November 18, 2025)

#### Active Work Assigned (But Not Completed)

The kanban board shows the factory had 3 high-priority items assigned to autonomous agents:

1. **🔄 Mistral LLM Integration & Role-Based AI Access**
   - *Assigned to:* santiago-developer
   - *Status:* In Progress (not completed)

2. **🔄 DGX Provisioning Automation**
   - *Assigned to:* santiago-architect
   - *Status:* In Progress (not completed)

3. **🔄 DGX Readiness Preparation**
   - *Assigned to:* santiago-architect
   - *Status:* In Progress (not completed)

#### Key Issue: CI/CD Pipeline Blockage

The factory was unable to complete any work last night due to **CI/CD pipeline failures** that blocked autonomous development:

- **Root Cause:** Import errors, missing dependencies, and test failures prevented the autonomous agents from executing
- **Impact:** Santiago Factory agents were halted and couldn't proceed with assigned tasks
- **Status:** All 3 assigned items remained in "In Progress" state

### Today's Resolution (November 19, 2025)

The CI/CD issues were identified and fixed today with these commits:

- Fixed PYTHONPATH and package import issues
- Updated LLM model names (grok-beta → grok-4-fast, gpt-5-nano)
- Added missing ProxyConfig fields with validation
- Corrected test expectations and API response structures
- Pushed all expedition branches to remote

### Current Status

- **Factory Status:** Ready for autonomous operation (CI/CD now passes locally)
- **Work Backlog:** 3 high-priority DGX deployment items still pending
- **Next Steps:** Factory can resume work once CI/CD pipeline passes in GitHub Actions

### Notes

The factory was essentially "stuck at the dock" last night due to quality gate failures, but the ship has been repaired and is ready to sail.
