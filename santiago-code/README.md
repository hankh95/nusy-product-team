# Santiago Code Workspace

Store Santiago-specific scripts, prototypes, and tests under this folder. Treat each subdirectory as a standalone experiment or agent module.

Suggested structure:

- `santiago-code/main/` – Primary orchestrator or CLI for Santiago.
- `santiago-code/tests/` – Minimal regression tests that prove catchfish/fishnet loops work.
- `santiago-code/docs/` – Short write-ups explaining how the Santiago variant differs from the broader PM stack.

Whenever you add code here, link it from a note in `notes/santiago/` and reference it in the KG so the Santiago agent can cite its own implementation history.
