# Vision for Hank's NuSy Self-Improvement AI 

## Overview
Hank, an experienced product manager, envisions creating a NuSy-based AI system that can autonomously manage and improve its own development processes. This AI will leverage NuSy's knowledge graph capabilities to learn, adapt to new requirements, and optimize its workflows over time.
## Key Features

## Core Architecture1. **Self-Reflective Knowledge Graph**: The AI will maintain a dynamic knowledge graph that captures its own development history, decisions, and outcomes. This graph will serve as the foundation for learning and adaptation.
2. **Adaptive Learning Mechanisms**: The AI will implement algorithms that allow it to analyze its past performance, identify areas for improvement, and adjust its strategies accordingly.
3. **Automated Experimentation Framework**: The system will include a framework for running experiments on its own processes, allowing it to test new approaches and validate improvements.
4. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: The AI will utilize CI/CD pipelines to ensure that changes are tested and deployed efficiently, enabling rapid iteration.
5. **User Feedback Integration**: The AI will incorporate feedback from Hank and other stakeholders to refine its understanding of requirements and improve its performance.

Vision of Components and Mapping to Old man and the Sea:
- **Self-Reflective Knowledge Graph**: Similar to Santiago's deep understanding of the sea and his own capabilities, the AI's knowledge graph will represent its self-awareness and learning journey.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanisms**: Just as Santiago adapts his fishing techniques based on his experiences, the AI will evolve its strategies based on past successes and failures.
- **Automated Experimentation Framework**: Like Santiago's trials and errors in his quest, the AI will experiment with different approaches to find the most effective methods for self-improvement.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Reflecting Santiago's relentless pursuit of his goal, the AI's CI/CD processes will ensure continuous progress and refinement.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Just as Santiago values the lessons learned from his experiences, the AI will incorporate feedback to enhance its development processes.
## Development Practices
1. **Hypothesis-Driven Development**: Each change or improvement will be treated as an experiment, with clear hypotheses, experiments, and success metrics documented in the knowledge graph.
2. **Test-First Approach**: New features and improvements will be defined through executable specifications (BDD/TDD) to ensure clarity and testability.
3. **Small Batch Sizes**: Changes will be made in small, manageable increments to facilitate rapid feedback and iteration.
4. **Transparent Documentation**: All decisions, experiments, and outcomes will be documented in the knowledge graph and relevant project artifacts to ensure transparency and traceability.
5. **Regular Knowledge Debriefs**: The AI will conduct regular reviews of its experiments and learning outcomes to update its knowledge graph and refine its strategies.
## Success Metrics
- **Improvement in Development Speed**: Measure the reduction in time taken to implement and deploy new features. AND the ability to be generalized to build domain specific Santiagos. (e.g., build a NuSy-based AI for healthcare, finance, etc.)
- **Quality of Deliverables**: Track the number of defects or issues reported post

Ideas on terms
Catchfish: The AI's ability to "catch" insights from its base loaded body of knowledge and turn that into knoweldge graph.  

# The process of going fishing with NuSy
1. we ask the boat builder what kind of boat he wants to build - the vision. Make an oncologist or cardiologist version of Santiago. We ask him what it needs to do. As these will typically be turned into MCP services we ask what kind of services it needs to provide. (knowledge and behaviors). In the case of my clniical guideline producer - it is able to answer any question that is covered in the clinical guideline. and it is able to serve as a CDS service. An EHR sends a FHIR patient bundle and asks it to return a medication recommendation or a care plan.
2. Ask them for, find and Store the raw materials - the sea. We find documents, data sources, APIs, experts - the fish in the sea.
3. We process the raw materials into structured knowledge - the fish.
and the process uses a NuSy version of catchfish.
4. we index it to be highly referenceable - the currents and winds
5. find and load ontologies - naming conventions, models and schemas - the maps and charts.
6. We store that information into a knowledge graph - the boat and fishing gear.
7. We then use NuSy fishnet to generate behavior tests that validate the knowledge graph and the MCP services - the fishing rules and regulations.
8. We then use NuSy navigator to orchestrate the catchfish and fishnet process until we have a high quality knowledge graph and behavior test suite - the fishing expedition itself.
9. this results in a knowledge graph and a set of MCP services that can be deployed - the catch.
10. The service is used and from it's core measurements and logs we learn how to improve it - the return to shore and lessons learned.

# NuSy Product Management System - The boat and crew	

There is a crew on the boat that helps with this process. This is the NuSy product team. (agents in the repo) All of the members of a development team have a role to play in this process. - but now as agents or a misture of human and AI roles.

While the team is building the boat and fishing gear - they are also using NuSy to help them build it. The NuSy PM agent is helping Hank manage the project. The NuSy architect is helping design the knowledge graph and the MCP services. The NuSy developer is helping implement the MCP services. The NuSy QA is helping test the MCP services and the knowledge graph. They may invent new roles as needed, and new tools to help them on their way. 

- **Automated Experimentation Framework**: Just as Santiago meticulously plans his fishing expeditions, the AI will systematically design and execute experiments to refine its development processes.
 4. We abstract the ideas from FHIR-CPG to create knowledge models, and activies that the AI can do. This is the fishing expedition itself.-deployment.
- **Adaptability**: Evaluate the AI's ability to adapt its strategies based on new information and feedback.
- **Knowledge Graph Growth**: Monitor the expansion and refinement of the knowledge
