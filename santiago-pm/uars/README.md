# Santiago-PM UARS (Unified Agent Role Specifications)

This directory contains the unified role specifications for all agents in the Santiago-PM domain.

## What is UARS?

UARS (Unified Agent Role Specification) is the single source of truth for agent definitions. Each UARS file contains:

- **Role Definition**: Purpose, responsibilities, scope of authority
- **Capability References**: Pointers to implemented tools (MCP manifest) and planned features (cargo manifests)
- **Behavioral Specification**: Communication style, decision criteria, work practices
- **Collaboration Patterns**: How this agent works with other roles
- **Governance**: Approval gates, escalation rules

## UARS Files

- `santiago-pm.uars.yaml` - Product Manager agent
- `architect-nusy.uars.yaml` - Knowledge Graph Architect
- `architect-systems.uars.yaml` - Systems/Platform Architect
- `developer.uars.yaml` - Software Developer
- `qa-specialist.uars.yaml` - QA Specialist
- `platform-engineer.uars.yaml` - Platform/Deployment Engineer
- `ux-researcher-designer.uars.yaml` - UX Researcher/Designer

## Reference-Based Architecture

UARS files use **references** rather than duplication:

```yaml
capability_references:
  # Points to authoritative sources
  implemented_tools:
    source: knowledge/catches/santiago-pm/mcp-manifest.json  # Current capabilities
  
  features_in_development:
    - feature_id: F-027
      source: santiago-pm/cargo-manifests/personal-log-feature.md  # Planned capabilities
  
  discovered_opportunities:
    source: santiago-pm/discovery-results.json  # Capability gaps
```

**Why references?**
- Single source of truth (no duplication)
- Automatic sync (update source, UARS reflects change)
- Simpler maintenance (UARS stays small)

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

- **MCP Manifest** (`knowledge/catches/*/mcp-manifest.json`): Generated by Navigator, defines implemented tools
- **Cargo Manifests** (`santiago-pm/cargo-manifests/*.md`): Feature specifications with planned tools
- **Discovery Results** (`santiago-pm/discovery-results.json`): Discovered work items and capability gaps
- **GitHub Agent Prompts** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`): Human-readable instructions for AI (manually synced from UARS)
- **Personas** (`santiago-pm/personas/*.md`): User personas who need these agent capabilities

## For Future MCP Integration

When MCP is fully implemented, UARS will support:

1. **Automated Prompt Generation**: Generate `.github/agents/*.agent.md` from UARS
2. **MCP Manifest Compilation**: Generate MCP manifest from UARS + cargo manifests
3. **Coverage Validation**: Check that all responsibilities have tools
4. **Evolution Tracking**: Monitor capability progression over time

For now, prompts are manually maintained with references to UARS for major updates.
