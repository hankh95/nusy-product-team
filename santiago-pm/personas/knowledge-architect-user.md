# Persona: Knowledge Graph Architect User

## Demographics
- **Role**: KG/Ontology Designer, Data Architect
- **Experience**: 5-10 years in knowledge engineering
- **Technical Background**: Graph databases, semantic web, ontologies
- **Domain Expertise**: Neurosymbolic AI, reasoning systems

## Goals & Motivations

### Primary Goals
1. **Design KG schemas** that support hypothesis-driven development
2. **Ensure KG coverage** for all product features
3. **Enable neurosymbolic reasoning** through proper ontology design
4. **Track provenance** for all inferences and decisions

### Secondary Goals
- Validate BDD scenarios have KG grounding
- Optimize query performance
- Document schema evolution
- Guide team on KG interaction patterns

## Pain Points

### Schema Evolution Challenges
- Hard to know if schema supports all hypotheses
- Missing KG concepts discovered late in development
- Schema changes break existing queries

### Coverage Gaps
- Features reference concepts not in KG
- No automated way to detect coverage gaps
- Manual validation is time-consuming

## Needs & Requirements

### Must Have
- **Coverage reports**: Show which KG concepts are used by features
- **Schema validation**: Ensure hypotheses have KG support
- **Provenance tracking**: (hypothesis → experiment → outcome → lesson)
- **Query patterns**: Reusable templates for common operations

### Nice to Have
- Automated schema suggestions
- Performance profiling for queries
- Visual schema diagrams
- Schema versioning and migration

## Behaviors & Patterns

### Work Style
- Schema-first design
- Validate early with PM
- Document all design decisions
- Test queries before deploying

### Decision Making
- Does schema support hypothesis validation?
- Is provenance trackable?
- Is performance acceptable?
- Can schema evolve without breaking changes?

## Success Metrics
- 100% feature-KG coverage
- Query latency < 100ms
- Zero schema-related blockers
- Clear provenance for all inferences

## User Journey
1. Receive feature spec from PM
2. Design KG schema to support feature
3. Validate with PM that hypothesis is testable
4. Implement schema and queries
5. Provide coverage report
6. Document for dev team
