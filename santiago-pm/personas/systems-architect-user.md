# Persona: Systems/Platform Architect User

## Profile
**Role**: Systems and Infrastructure Architect
**Experience**: 8+ years architecture and systems design
**Technical**: MCP, microservices, CI/CD, cloud architecture

## Goals
- Design scalable, observable, deployable systems
- Balance trade-offs (speed vs reliability vs cost)
- Define non-functional requirements clearly
- Enable fast feedback loops

## Pain Points
- Non-functional requirements often overlooked
- Hard to represent infrastructure constraints in backlog
- Architecture decisions not documented
- Integration testing is complex

## Needs
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Non-functional requirements in KG
- CI/CD templates and patterns
- Performance/cost modeling

## Success Metrics
- System reliability: >99.9%
- Feedback loop time: <30 min (CI/CD)
- Cost efficiency: Within 10% of target
- Architecture decisions documented: 100%

## Journey
Feature spec → Architecture design → NFR definition → Implementation guidance → Review → Monitor
