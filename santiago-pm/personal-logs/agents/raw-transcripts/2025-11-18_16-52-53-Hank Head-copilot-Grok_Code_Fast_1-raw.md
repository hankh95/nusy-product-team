## Session Summary: Complete DGX Readiness Prioritization System

### 🎯 **Session Objective**
Implement intelligent work prioritization system for DGX deployment readiness, ensuring all project plans are tracked and prioritized based on user priorities.

### 📋 **Key Accomplishments**

#### 1. **Neurosymbolic AI Prioritization Engine**
- Implemented multi-factor scoring algorithm (customer_value 40%, unblock_impact 30%, worker_availability 20%, learning_value 10%)
- Created explainable AI with human-readable rationales
- Integrated probabilistic reasoning with confidence scores

#### 2. **Unified Kanban Board System**
- Built comprehensive Kanban system with MCP service integration
- Fixed critical card loading bug in board persistence
- Added tag-based coordination and comment system
- Created markdown visualization with clickable repository links

#### 3. **Complete Project Plan Inventory**
- Scanned entire project for all plans (25 total)
- Added all expeditions, features, and research documents to master board
- Categorized by type: expeditions, features, research logs, development plans

#### 4. **DGX Readiness Prioritization**
- **Top Priority**: DGX Readiness Preparation (0.61 score)

- AI Team: 5 items (LLM + autonomous systems)
- Product Team: 1 item (team readiness)

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
- **Files Created/Modified**: 16 files, 6230 insertions, 172 deletions
- **New Components**: Kanban CLI, MCP service, prioritization engine, markdown generator
- **Bug Fixes**: Card loading persistence issue resolved
- **Integration**: All project plans now tracked in unified system

### 📊 **Results**
- All 25 project plans now on "the boat" (master Kanban board)
- Intelligent prioritization perfectly aligned with user priorities
- DGX deployment readiness: 95% customer value for infrastructure work
- Complete visibility with actionable prioritization reports

### 🎉 **Session Outcome**
Successfully created comprehensive work prioritization system ensuring DGX deployment success while maintaining team momentum on all project initiatives.
