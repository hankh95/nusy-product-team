# Notes Hub for Santiago

This folder collects human-facing and agent-friendly notes tied to the Santiago mini-project.

- `notes/santiago/` houses progressive write-ups, insights, and experiment retrospectives for the current Santiago version.
- Use these notes to capture hypotheses, blockers, or sync items before they move into the NuSy knowledge graph.
- Historical note: `santiago-code/` artifacts were archived (tag `prototype-archive-2025-11-16`). Do not create new links there; reference migration planning docs instead.

The former NuSy Notes CLI (`python -m src.nusy_pm_core.cli notes`) was part of the archived prototype. The `notes/notes_manifest.json` remains as a historical artifact; new note ingestion patterns will be defined in the regenerated pipeline.
