# Notes Hub for Santiago

This folder collects human-facing and agent-friendly notes tied to the Santiago mini-project.

- `notes/santiago/` houses progressive write-ups, insights, and experiment retrospectives for the current Santiago version.
- Use these notes to capture hypotheses, blockers, or sync items before they move into the NuSy knowledge graph.
- Entries should link back to `santiago-code/` artifacts when they reference code, tests, or deployment scripts.
