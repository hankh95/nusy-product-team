# Santiago Development Session - November 15, 2025

## Autonomous Experiment Implementation

### Changes Made
- **AgentAdapter**: Implemented real OpenAI API integration with async client
- **ExperimentRunnerService**: Replaced all placeholder behaviors with actual agent collaboration
- **Decision Queue**: Modified to use agents for autonomous decision-making
- **Requirements**: Added openai package dependency

### Key Features Implemented
1. **AI Agent Roles**:
   - Quartermaster: Ethical overseer with Baha'i principles
   - Pilot: PM domain expert with methodology knowledge
   - Santiago: Orchestrator coordinating the swarm

2. **Autonomous Behaviors**:
   - Agent initialization with API connectivity tests
   - Inter-agent communication establishment
   - PM knowledge ingestion and ethical validation
   - Collaborative feature proposal and implementation planning
   - Self-evaluation and improvement recommendations

3. **Decision Autonomy**:
   - All decisions now resolved by agents without human input
   - Quartermaster provides ethical guidance for critical choices
   - Full 21-day experiment cycle can run independently

### Technical Implementation
- Used OpenAI AsyncOpenAI client for concurrent agent interactions
- Implemented proper async/await patterns throughout
- Added comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing interfaces

### Testing & Quality Gates
- Created BDD feature file: `features/autonomous_experiment.feature`
- Added comprehensive unit tests: `tests/test_experiment_runner.py`
- Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies
- All changes follow TDD/BDD first principle

### Knowledge Graph Updates
- New relationships: AgentCollaboration -> EthicalDecisionMaking
- Captured autonomous development patterns for future reuse
- Documented agent interaction protocols

### Next Steps
- Ready to run full autonomous experiment
- Monitor agent performance and learning curves
- Capture experiment results for KG integration
- Plan next iteration improvements based on autonomous feedback
