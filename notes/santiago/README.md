# Santiago Notes

The `notes/santiago/` directory is dedicated to capturing the story, learnings, and questions for the first Santiago iteration.

Guidelines:

- Start each note with a date/title and tag whether it is a plan, experiment, or retrospective.
- Keep entries short (≤2 minutes of reading) but include links to code, KG nodes, or artifacts referenced.
- If a note references a decision, update `santiago-code/` with the corresponding implementation so the note can point to concrete outcomes.
