# Chat History: 2025-11-15_12-55-14

## Session Summary

This chat session focused on project cleanup and organization for the NuSy Product Team project.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Updated Development Plan**
   - Marked Autonomous Multi-Agent Experiment as COMPLETED
   - Integrated backlog items into Phase 3 (Secrets Management, PM Domain Organization, Source Knowledge Loading)
   - Updated next steps to prioritize running the experiment

2. **Backlog Cleanup**
   - Reviewed and integrated `autonomous-multi-agent-backlog.md` into `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
   - Deleted the backlog file and folder
   - Incorporated remaining high-priority items into the plan

3. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Moved `experiments/` folder to `nusy_pm/expeditions/`
   - Created individual subfolders for each experiment with contained artifacts:
     - Hypothesis (markdown files)
     - Code (experiment_runner.py)
     - Results (reports/)
   - Removed unrelated workspace file

4. **Quality Assessment Templates**
   - Created slug templates in `nusy_pm/quality-assessments/`:
     - `experiment-quality-slug.md`
     - `feature-quality-slug.md`
     - `system-quality-slug.md`

5. **Feature Linking System**
   - Added YAML frontmatter to `autonomous_experiment.feature` with:
     - Unique ID system
     - Links to related expeditions
     - Related artifacts references
     - Status and epic information

## Current Project State

- Autonomous experiment implementation: ✅ COMPLETED
- Next priority: Run the autonomous experiment using `experiment_runner.py`
- Project structure: Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- Quality templates: Ready for feedback CLI integration

## VS Code Issue

During this session, VS Code reported "no folder associated with the workspace" - likely requires reopening the workspace folder.

## Next Steps

1. Reopen VS Code workspace (`nusy-product-team.code-workspace`)
2. Run autonomous experiment: `python nusy_pm/expeditions/autonomous-multi-agent-swarm/experiment_runner.py`
3. Continue with Phase 3: Secrets Management Service implementation
