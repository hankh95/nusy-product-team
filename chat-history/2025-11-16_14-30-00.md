# Chat History: 2025-11-16_14-30-00

## Session Summary

This chat session focused on resolving repository structure issues and establishing consistent folder naming conventions for the Santiago autonomous AI framework.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Repository Structure Cleanup**
   - Identified and resolved Python package naming conflict
   - Renamed `santiago_core` folder through multiple iterations to resolve import issues
   - Established consistent naming: underscores for Python packages, dashes for other directories

2. **Python Package Integrity**
   - Verified all Python imports work correctly with `santiago_core` package
   - Tested package structure and internal module dependencies
   - Confirmed autonomous AI framework is ready for development

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated all file path references across the codebase
   - Modified scaffold templates for new project generation
   - Updated strategic charts and feature specifications
   - Fixed references in PHASE reports and README files

4. **Ships Log Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive ships log entry for repository cleanup work
   - Documented all changes and verification steps
   - Linked to knowledge graph concepts and related entities

## Technical Details

- **Problem**: Python packages require underscores in folder names, but development practices preferred dashes
- **Solution**: Maintained `santiago_core` for Python compatibility while keeping `santiago-pm`, `santiago-code` with dashes
- **Files Updated**: 15+ files across templates, documentation, and code
- **Verification**: All Python imports tested and working

## Current Project State

- Repository structure: ✅ Clean and consistent
- Python packages: ✅ All imports working
- Documentation: ✅ Updated and accurate
- Santiago framework: ✅ Ready for autonomous development

## Next Steps

- Continue with Phase 3 development of the Santiago autonomous AI system
- Implement enhanced task coordination and code generation capabilities
- Test the autonomous experiment runner with the cleaned repository structure
