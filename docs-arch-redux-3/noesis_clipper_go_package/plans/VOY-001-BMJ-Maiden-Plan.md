# Noesis Clipper – Maiden Voyage Launch Plan (Base)

**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Voyage ID:** VOY-001-BMJ-Maiden  
**Status:** Ready for Launch  

This is the base launch plan for the BMJ → Machine-Executable Knowledge Maiden Voyage on the DGX. It is complemented by the Option 1, Option 2, Hybrid, and DGX Operations documents in this package.

## 1. Mission Summary

Convert BMJ Best Practice content for selected topics into an expanded semantic graph with:

- More sections covered than the current semantic-only graph
- Logic, time, and sequence gaps filled
- FHIR-capable knowledge produced at the same time

Initial win condition:  
> Deliver a complete, logic-filled framed-file set for at least one BMJ topic in **4 weeks**.

Grand slam condition:  
> Deliver an expanded semantic graph + logic + FHIR-capable knowledge for many topics, establishing a repeatable pattern for all 1,050 topics.

## 2. High-level Structure

The Maiden Voyage is split into two streams:

- **Option 1:** BMJ Delivery Accelerator (improve the existing BMJ codebase using Santiago + DGX)
- **Option 2:** Santiago-Doctor-BMJ (build a Santiago-native domain expert and strengthen the platform)

A Hybrid Master Plan coordinates both and defines checkpoints where you may switch BMJ-focused work to the winning approach.
