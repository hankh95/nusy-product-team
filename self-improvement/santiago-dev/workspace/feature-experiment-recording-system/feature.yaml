title: "Experiment Recording System - Complete Session Capture for Learning"
expedition: "EXP-052"
priority: "high"
status: "draft"
created: "2025-11-18"
assignee: "santiago-dev"

description: |
  Implement a comprehensive experiment recording system that captures complete chat sessions,
  file states, and time-based changes to enable pattern analysis and learning optimization.
  This system will record all interactions, decisions, and outcomes for retrospective analysis
  and continuous improvement of autonomous development processes.

business_value: |
  - **Learning Acceleration**: Complete session capture enables pattern recognition and optimization
  - **Process Improvement**: Retrospective analysis of successful and failed experiments
  - **Knowledge Preservation**: All interactions and decisions are preserved for future reference
  - **Collaborative Learning**: Shared experiment records across the team for collective improvement

acceptance_criteria:
  - Complete chat sessions are captured with full context
  - File states are recorded at key decision points
  - Time-series analysis of experiment progression is supported
  - Pattern recognition algorithms can analyze recorded data
  - Privacy and security controls protect sensitive information
  - Search and retrieval of experiment records is efficient

dependencies:
  - memory-snapshot-service: ">=1.0.0"
  - santiago-core: ">=1.0.0"
  - pydantic: For data validation
  - yaml: For configuration

risks:
  - Storage requirements for comprehensive session capture
  - Performance impact on interactive sessions
  - Privacy concerns with complete session recording
  - Complexity of correlating multiple data streams

success_metrics:
  - Session capture completeness: >99%
  - Query response time: <500ms
  - Storage efficiency: >70% compression ratio
  - Pattern recognition accuracy: >85%

  - santiago-core: Learning pattern integration
  - privacy-officer: Security and privacy compliance

notes: |
  This system directly supports the learning patterns identified in the memory architecture analysis,
  particularly observational pairing and experiment recording for continuous improvement.
  The MVP foundation with Copilot interface provides an excellent baseline for enhancement.
