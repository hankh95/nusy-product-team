# Calibration Artifacts (Do Not Read Before Submitting)

Purpose: support fair comparison across AI architecture reviews without biasing initial outputs.

- Independence rule: AIs must NOT read any files in `calibration/` until after they finish their deliverables.
- After submission: AIs may compare their `RELEVANCE_MAP.md` to the canonical reference below and append a brief calibration appendix to their own map.

## Canonical References

- Relevance map (canonical): `ocean-arch-redux/arch-redux-gpt-5-v2-plan/RELEVANCE_MAP.md`

Notes:

- The canonical map intentionally remains outside the default scan set and within `ocean-arch-redux/` to preserve independence.
- This folder only contains pointers/instructions, not the reference content itself.
