## Reflection Questions for Team

As we build Santiago Factory, let us continually ask:

- Does this honor the nobility of every human person?
- Are we serving genuine needs or creating artificial desires?
- Who is excluded or harmed by our choices?
- Are we building for collective flourishing or individual advantage?
- What is our long-term impact on human capacity and potential?
- Are we maintaining unity of purpose while respecting diversity?

Let service to humanity be our measure of success.
