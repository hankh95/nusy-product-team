@master @sea
Feature: design_experiment
  Create hypothesis-driven voyage trial with phases, success criteria, risk mitigation

  Background:
    the Santiago PM MCP service is running
    the knowledge graph is initialized with test data
    I have Master level permissions

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Successfully execute design_experiment
    Given the Santiago PM knowledge graph is initialized
    When I invoke the 'design_experiment' MCP tool
    Then the MCP tool should succeed
    Then the knowledge graph should be updated

  @edge_case
  Scenario: Handle edge cases for design_experiment
    Given the Santiago PM knowledge graph is initialized
    Given I provide boundary value inputs
    When I invoke the 'design_experiment' MCP tool
    Then the MCP tool should handle edge cases gracefully
    Then the knowledge graph should remain consistent
    Then the response should be valid

  @error_handling
  Scenario: Handle errors for design_experiment
    Given the Santiago PM knowledge graph is initialized
    Given I provide invalid parameter types
    When I invoke the 'design_experiment' MCP tool
    Then the MCP tool should return an error
    Then the error message should be descriptive
