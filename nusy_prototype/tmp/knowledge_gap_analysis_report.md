## Gap Analysis Summary

### Content Coverage Across Pipeline Stages

| Pipeline Stage | Coverage | Percentage |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| Best Practice Source | 9/9 | 100.0% |
| L0 Model Processing | 9/9 | 100.0% |
| Anchor Extraction | 9/9 | 100.0% |

### Gap Classification Breakdown

- **Graph Translation Gap:** 9 questions (100.0%)


## Key Findings

### Primary Gap Sources:
1. **Missing from Best Practice Source** (0 questions)
   - Knowledge not covered in the original Best Practice topic
   - Requires content expansion or guideline updates

2. **Missed in Translation** (0 questions)
   - Knowledge exists in Best Practice but not captured in L0 processing
   - Pipeline extraction issues

3. **Anchor Extraction Incomplete** (0 questions)
   - Content processed in L0 but anchoring failed
   - Need improved anchoring algorithms

4. **Graph Translation Gap** (9 questions)
   - Content in L0/anchors but not converted to knowledge graph
   - CI-tagging process needs enhancement

## Recommendations for Knowledge Authoring Team

- 9 topics in L0/anchors but not in graph - improve CI-tagging process


## Path Forward

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Review Best Practice Content:** Identify topics genuinely missing from source material
2. **Audit L0 Processing:** Check why existing content is missed in extraction
3. **Enhance Anchoring:** Improve anchor extraction for processed content
4. **Strengthen CI-Tagging:** Ensure all anchored content reaches the knowledge graph

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Content Expansion:** Add missing clinical topics to Best Practice
2. **Pipeline Reliability:** Improve extraction consistency and coverage
3. **Quality Assurance:** Add validation steps at each pipeline stage
4. **Feedback Loop:** Enable gap identification and content enhancement

## Conclusion

The 5.1% gap to 100% confidence is due to **knowledge gaps in the pipeline**, not reasoning limitations. Analysis shows that 100.0% of failing topics exist in the Best Practice source, indicating the primary issues are in the **translation pipeline** rather than missing source content.

**Key Insight:** Most gaps (9/9) are due to pipeline failures where existing knowledge is not properly extracted and translated to the knowledge graph.
