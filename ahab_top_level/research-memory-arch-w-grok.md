# Grok Memory Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the memory architecture for Grok, focusing on efficient storage, retrieval, and management of contextual information.

## Key Components

### Memory Types
- **Short-term Memory**: For immediate context and recent interactions
- **Long-term Memory**: For persistent knowledge and learned patterns
- **Episodic Memory**: For specific conversation histories and events

### Storage Mechanisms
- **Vector Embeddings**: For semantic search and similarity matching
- **Graph Structures**: For relational knowledge representation
- **Hierarchical Indexing**: For scalable retrieval

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
- Vector databases for embeddings
- Graph databases for relationships
- Time-series storage for temporal data

### Retrieval Strategies
- Semantic similarity search
- Contextual relevance scoring
- Temporal decay functions

## Performance Considerations
- Memory limits and pruning strategies
- Compression techniques
- Distributed storage options

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-modal memory integration
- Adaptive memory allocation
- Privacy-preserving memory sharing
