Feature: Autonomous Development Enhancement
  As a development team
  We need to enhance the autonomous development system
  So that it can work more efficiently and take on complex tasks

  Background:
    Given Santiago-Dev autonomous system is operational
    And DGX readiness work is complete
    And continuous improvement is needed

  @high @enhancement
  Scenario: Performance Monitoring Implementation
    Given autonomous system is running
    When we implement performance monitoring
    Then system metrics should be collected
    And performance bottlenecks should be identified
    And optimization recommendations should be generated

  @high @enhancement
  Scenario: Multi-Agent Coordination
    Given multiple autonomous agents exist
    When we implement coordination mechanisms
    Then agents should communicate effectively
    And work should be distributed optimally
    And conflicts should be resolved automatically

  @medium @enhancement
  Scenario: External Integration Expansion
    Given system works with internal components
    When we add external integrations
    Then GitHub issues should be processed
    And external APIs should be accessible
    And third-party tools should be integrated

  @medium @enhancement
  Scenario: Advanced Task Planning
    Given current planning is basic
    When we implement advanced planning
    Then complex multi-step tasks should be decomposed
    And dependencies should be automatically identified
    And optimal execution order should be determined

  @low @enhancement
  Scenario: Self-Improvement Capabilities
    Given system can execute tasks
    When we add self-improvement features
    Then code quality should be automatically improved
    And performance should be continuously optimized
    And new capabilities should be autonomously developed
