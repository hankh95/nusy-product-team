# Relevance Map (v3)

## Relevant (Design-Driving)

- `ocean-research/00-ARCHITECTURE-PATTERN.md` — Factory insight (Navigator, Catchfish, Fishnet) and bootstrapping order.
- `santiago-pm/strategic-charts/Old man and the sea.md` — The 10-step fishing workflow Navigator must encode.
- `santiago-pm/` (expeditions, tackle, voyage-trials) — Process backbone for hypotheses, implementation slices, and validation.
- `ocean-research/building-on-DGX/dgx_spark_nusy_report.md` — DGX Spark constraints and practices for shared model hosting.
- `nusy_prototype/` — Evidence that 4-layer extraction + 3-cycle validation works at 30–60 minutes per source.

## Peripheral (Contextual)

- `experiments/` — Historical explorations that can inspire backlog hypotheses.
- `notes/` — Domain snapshots and ontology hints for Catchfish pilots.
- `config/experiment.json` — Runtime parameters for experiments (non-canonical for architecture).

## Legacy / Archive

- `src/nusy_pm_core/`, `santiago-code/` — Prior prototypes worth retaining for archaeology, not patterns.

## Gaps to Create

- `knowledge/` root with `catches/`, `templates/`, and `proxy-instructions/`.
- `knowledge/catches/index.yaml` trust registry (parity %, validations, last-updated).
- MCP proxy services under `santiago_core/agents/_proxy/` for Phase 0.
- `nusy_orchestrator/santiago_builder/` with Navigator, Catchfish, Fishnet, and `pipelines/`.
- `ships-logs/expeditions/` for repeatable, timestamped outcome logs.
