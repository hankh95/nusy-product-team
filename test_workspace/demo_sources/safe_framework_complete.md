# SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) for Product Management

## Core Principles

SAFe emphasizes Program Increment Planning where teams synchronize their work.
The Product Manager requires Strategic Theme alignment and backlog prioritization.
Value Stream Mapping helps identify flow bottlenecks and optimize delivery.

## Key Practices

1. **Backlog Management**: Product Manager creates and prioritizes features
2. **PI Planning**: Coordinate multiple teams through Program Increment cycles
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear success metrics for each feature
4. **Velocity Tracking**: Monitor team throughput and predict capacity
5. **Iteration Planning**: Break features into 2-week sprints

## Roles

- **Product Manager**: Owns vision, roadmap, and prioritization
- **Release Train Engineer**: Facilitates planning and coordination
- **Business Owner**: Provides funding and strategic direction
