# Issue: Capture the first Santiago session note

- **Assignees:** Copilot agents working on the Santiago mini-project.

## Description

We need a human-readable note in `notes/santiago/` describing the start of the Santiago experiment. It should summarize the goal, instrumentation plan, and how to keep the knowledge graph self-reflective.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create `notes/santiago/<date>-santiago-kickoff.md` (use today’s date) with sections for vision, hypotheses, and blockers.
- [ ] Link the new note to the Santiago development plan (`notes/santiago-development-plan.md`).
- [ ] Reference any relevant KG schema or artifacts so the Navigator agent can tie the note back to real data.
- [ ] Update the README in `notes/santiago/` if new conventions emerge while writing.
