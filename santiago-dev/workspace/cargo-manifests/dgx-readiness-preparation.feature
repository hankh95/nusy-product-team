Feature: DGX Readiness Preparation Expedition
  As a NuSy development team
  We need to prepare for DGX arrival
  So that we can maximize utilization and research capabilities

  Background:
    Given the DGX has been ordered
    And we have November 18, 2025 as current date
    And we need to be maximally prepared

  Scenario: Review DGX Documentation
    Given DGX documentation is available
    When we analyze all DGX specifications and capabilities
    Then we should identify key research opportunities
    And determine optimal configuration for NuSy workloads
    And create comprehensive readiness checklist

  @completed
  Scenario: Sub-Expedition Planning
    Given DGX capabilities are understood
    When we assess current infrastructure gaps
    Then we should identify required sub-expeditions
    And prioritize preparation activities
    And assign tasks to appropriate team members

  @completed
  Scenario: Environment Preparation
    Given sub-expeditions are identified
    When we execute preparation activities
    Then DGX environment should be ready
    And integration with existing systems should be complete
    And performance benchmarks should be established

  @completed
  Scenario: Research Planning
    Given DGX is ready for operation
    When we plan initial research activities
    Then we should have prioritized research roadmap
    And resource allocation should be optimized
    And success metrics should be defined

  @completed
  Scenario: Expedition Execution
    Given all planning phases are complete
    When the autonomous system executes the expedition
    Then comprehensive DGX readiness plan should be generated
    And detailed implementation roadmap should be created
    And success metrics should be established
