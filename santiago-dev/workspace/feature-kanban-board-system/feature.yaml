Feature: Unified Kanban Board System
  As a project management system
  We need a unified Kanban board for workflow tracking
  So that all work items can be managed through a single visual interface

  Background:
    Given multiple development tracking files create confusion
    And we need a single source of truth for the overall boat
    And individual Santiagos should maintain their own sub-boards
    And work items should be linked, not duplicated

  @critical @kanban @workflow
  Scenario: Board Creation and Management
    Given a new Kanban board needs to be created
    When we initialize the board system
    Then we should create standard columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, Done)
    And establish board hierarchy (master + agent sub-boards)
    And set up persistence for board state

  @critical @kanban @workflow
  Scenario: Card Creation from Repository Items
    Given work items exist in the knowledge graph/git repository
    When we create Kanban cards
    Then cards should reference items by ID/path, not copy data
    And card metadata should include item type and location
    And cards should display key information from referenced items

  @high @kanban @workflow
  Scenario: State Transitions and Workflow
    Given cards are placed in columns
    When users move cards between columns
    Then the underlying item's state should be updated
    And state transition history should be recorded
    And workflow rules should be enforced

  @high @kanban @workflow
  Scenario: Hierarchical Board Management
    Given master board exists for overall boat
    When sub-boards are created for individual agents
    Then cards can be promoted/demoted between board levels
    And cross-agent dependencies should be visible
    And board synchronization should be maintained

  @medium @kanban @interface
  Scenario: Visual Board Interface
    Given users need to interact with the board
    When they access the Kanban interface
    Then they should see drag-and-drop card movement
    And real-time updates across users
    And filtering and search capabilities

  @medium @kanban @integration
  Scenario: Knowledge Graph Integration
    Given board state needs to be queryable
    When we integrate with the knowledge graph
    Then board data should be accessible via KG queries
    And relationships between cards should be modeled
    And analytics and reporting should be supported

  @low @kanban @automation
  Scenario: Automated Card Management
    Given workflow rules are defined
    When conditions are met
    Then cards should automatically transition columns
    And notifications should be sent to stakeholders
    And dependent work should be triggered
