# Relevance Map — Combined Hybrid v3 Plan

---

## Relevant

- `ocean-research/00-ARCHITECTURE-PATTERN.md` — Mandatory factory pattern guidance
- `santiago-pm/strategic-charts/Old man and the sea.md` — 10-step fishing process (Navigator blueprint)
- `santiago-pm/expeditions/` — Hypothesis-driven experiments (progressive replacement methodology)
- `santiago-pm/tackle/` — Modular implementation units (factory code structuring hints)
- `santiago-pm/voyage-trials/` — BDD testing style and expectations (Fishnet alignment)
- `ocean-research/building-on-DGX/` — DGX deployment specs (vLLM/TensorRT, SLIs)
- `nusy_prototype/` — Evidence for 30–60m extraction, 3 validation cycles (Catchfish design)
- `santiago_core/` — Active service scaffolding and integration surface for proxies/real Santiagos

## Peripheral

- `experiments/`, `backlog/`, `reports/`, `notes/` — Contextual strategy and historical artifacts
- `ocean-research/manolin_multi_agent_architecture.md` — Shared memory & concurrency patterns (useful but not primary)
- `docs/`, `calibration/`, `tools/` — Tooling and documentation support

## Legacy-Duplicate

- `santiago-code/` — Archived experiments; preserve for reference, avoid duplication
- `src/nusy_pm_core/` — Legacy prototype; reference only, do not refactor into factory

## GAP

- `knowledge/` — Must be created with `catches/`, `templates/`, `proxy-instructions/`, and trust registry (`knowledge/catches/index.yaml`)
- `santiago_core/agents/_proxy/` — Fake team proxy directory; create thin MCP services per role
- `nusy_orchestrator/santiago_builder/` — Factory components (Navigator, Catchfish, Fishnet) built by fake team
