# Installation Instructions:
# pip install -r requirements-nusy.txt
#
# For development with all optional packages:
# pip install -r requirements-nusy.txt
#
# For minimal installation (core only):
# pip install rdflib>=6.0.0

# Version Compatibility Notes:
# - Python 3.7+: Required for typing module features
# - RDFLib 6.0+: Required for JSON-LD parsing improvements
# - PyTorch: Install with CUDA support if GPU acceleration needed
#   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Platform-Specific Notes:
# - Linux/macOS: Full compatibility
# - Windows: May require additional setup for some ML packages
# - ARM64: Limited support for some ML packages

# Security Considerations:
# - Pin versions in production deployments
# - Regularly update for security patches
# - Use virtual environments for isolation
