# Extreme Programming (XP) for Product Management

## Core Values

XP emphasizes Customer Collaboration through frequent feedback cycles.
Small Batch Sizes allow rapid adaptation to changing requirements.
Test-First Development ensures quality is built in from the start.

## Key Practices

1. **User Stories**: Write stories using INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
2. **Story Mapping**: Visualize user journey and prioritize by value
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define testable conditions for story completion
4. **Velocity Tracking**: Use historical data for realistic planning
5. **Continuous Planning**: Adapt backlog based on learning

## Integration with SAFe
