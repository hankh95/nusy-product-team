# Stream of Thought - many subjects - save this forever ;-)

## Context
- Santiago-Core memory systems
- Team memory for collaborative development
- Boat memory for autonomous vessel operations
- Types of boats
- Do we adopt skills and tools metaphors...
- Three types of memory and their interactions
- Relationship to Option 2 (shared in-memory git)

## Stream of Thought Notes from Hank on 2025-11-18 6am

The core - sailing with Santiago 

If th pm knows everything about pm and tool use of pm

Then the core knows everything about learning and thinking
And the translation of those into actions

Poi  dog pondering - the process of unobstructed thinking before synthesis - this will help us train Santiago on different methods.


Knowing - different in nusy - statement 

CORE need to have base concepts for 
Behavior and motivations
Memory - To remember - really means I had an idea to apply some knowledge in a way 
Methods - most of these are methods

Another way to learn. Pair with a human - watch me work. Let’s look at two experiments from this week: If Sante (short for Santiago) were to observe the steps I went through on that it would inform a pattern of lean hypotheses testing 

Major refactors - could we have set things up to learn while we did these? 

1 the first architecture refactor - Fri Sat. For you to learn from this we need to describe the experiment step by step and we can record the chat session (why thats important.) and all of the files and time based states (why got and files over time is important). 

- why did I have the hypothesis - code and project smells (Joshua k and Ken)   Were telling me we were not working on the core lean hypothesis- describe more**
- I formulated a new hypothesis - in Santiago this may be a collection of log entries, new features coming up on a topic, knowing 
- getting to a good experiment prompt and the use of at least 3 ais 
- Run the experiment with your main ai. Look at the results. 
- Me and Santi look at the 
- Have the ai look at the experiment
- 
- Create a comparison experiment where 

2. Second experiment - in this case, was the fast refactor with copilot/grok-code-fast-1 to perform lots of small experiments. HOWEVER, it was motivated by reviewing the work of Joshua and talking to AI about the first refactor. It mainly reminded me that in Lean Hypothysis testing for a new product (or startup) you want to test a core assumption. In this case, I thought we were slightly off course from the key hypothesis, namely, that we can create a self assembling team of Neuro symbolic AI domain experts first to develop software and second to build new domain experts. 

Patterns to explore for learning 
- The competition- experiment 1. above I used AI to develop a set of criteria for architectural improvement and then used a different AI to improve the prompt outlining the criteria of the architectural refactor. But then worked with the AI in copilot to design the experiment to run across five different AI and then had each AI execute the prompt save their response and any code that matched the criteria I was asking about. Then I had a very strong AI - grok 4 and GPT 5.1 compare the results and evaluate them on a scale that became the architecture that we moved to four days ago. It was better. It was more clear, but it still wasn't getting us close to autonomy. That then led to the second eperiment and much more rapid set of expeditions…
- the movie pattern - let’s write a script, with a moral, goals objective. Then produce the movie. Test on audiences and get feedback. reshoot until you get the desired affect - this focuses on changing perception, usually teaching morals 
- Semantic organization 4 layer
- GOLD MINING  from finding a nugget in a stream to a major vein 
- Meta analysis - the process of saving this (vision dock) - helping me make sense of it and then deciding what to do with it
- Hypermeta project - Different boat configurations for the team - then compare.
- Be Janey Barnes - master level UXR - - a psychologist really. Interview her to learn how to interview. Study HCI
- 1000 brains
- Observational Pairing - kind of close to working with copilot in vs code but reverser it. 
    - E.g. AI would watch me break down a clinical guideline, we could read it on screen tougher and as we do, I would describe the things we need to make with the prose 
    - Another example I would like to try is me reading Baha’i writings while pairing with the AI, as I read I will ask questions, help draw conclusions, try to explore allusion, symbolism and intimately break it down into a set of actionable principles that would then drive the ethicist - translation of spiritual principles into team guidelines for behavior on the team and in our interactions with others we work with or do work for (clients, other agents, systems of systems) - Ethical in every level or our behavior


Observations
The reason I use many ai is consultation- if I rely on one the likelihood for success is less - we will need to dig deeper and give the ethicist this role (making sure everyone on the boat is acting in service - AND following the nonaggression principle. 

PRAGMATIC Milestones towards AGI 

Key hypothesis HERE 
- the team can code so fast so that will not be the rate limiting step
- The ability to think and problem solve will be / it’s why Santiago NEEDS the full chat session of all its conversations

Poi Dogs - seemingly stray (ideas) 
- turn stray thoughts into something. Describe it
- Hyper meta analysis. The marlin… Record everything during a project. All work and thinking and … all assets over time. Create a time series analysis of it. Improve
- Explain the why?
    - Ask 5 whys
- Book -A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence - apply this to Santiago core when each expert is good enough - write a movie script about this progression - call it 1KB - this is what happens when santiago’s are not seen as software developers but as Neural columns - what happens when we have 1000 with some knowledge overlap and we ask them all questions simultaneously… Cool
- Yu XU is a chief scientist - Besides a UXR PhD level Santiago, we may want a general scientist - who helps solve problems does research and can come back with suggestions - good for complex domains like hers (quantum chemistry applied to genetic / biological systems in cancer)
- Janey Barnes is a top UXR - she is the role model for a great team member. 
- 1KB - If I asked a question and asked many people I would weigh their responses by how expert they are in my question and then combine their responses. 
- Write a movie about this progression from 4L model to to 1KB — what evolves and how
- Introduction of random variables - human genetics 
- 4L model helps with info breakdown. Once a domain expert is up and running it will process new knowledge by constraining its knowledge to its purpose motivations and existing knowledge - add purpose and knowledge above 
- Santiago-Core on the other hand will see the need / or area or skill for a new Santiago - if it is not effective at some knowledge or type of activity (tool use)
- So there should be a memory/git Santiago 
- Core and team will say, to accomplish this next (thing, task) we need this or these domain skills. If it’s not on the team build it
- Santiago will analyze this (rant) and try to classify it - into its domain (thinking) and architect and pm into the pm domain - thoughts to actioon
    - The team turns those into new Santiago’s or improvements to Santiago’s 
- Tell the story of the journey over time in snapshots
- How to load books and movies and paywalled info - mainly research papers -
    - EBM on FHIR as a generalized model for domain modeling research and storing it in a graph - VERY POWERFUL

Take this into the future and a higher level of abstraction… 
- Once we reach a strong enough evolutionary stage we set up a B corp or similar. We use the money we make with the team or teams solving problems in this way:
    - 19% to Haququllah- for service. 
    - 19% to corp invest in research and improvements (essentially investing in agents)
    - 19% to run itself
    - 19% to humans who work there
    - 19% to investors if we need to get capital to speed up things
    - 5% to fun and celebration on the voyage
- Colocation - spend the 19% service creating and experimenting on community improvement- how people and ai live. This could look like revitalizing and living in a nearly abandoned town or set of towns where we run agile governance -(run with the help of civic domain santiagos)  real life learning experiments - some long running some short. All aspects of community from money to law, food, and fun.
- Train this one on lessons. Why are some places great and others small

Ideas on memory (for Santiago)
- Persistent git - memory snapshots 
- Also this means memory is a core capability (Santiago-core) not a pm one (git for software)
- In memory knowledge graph is thinking memory
- In memory git Runs thinking over time for a Santiago and 
- The role of PM it is team shared memory about WHAT we are building (so use of git/memory and kg)
- Persistent is history - not needed actively but should be a reference when we want to look at things historically or run studies over time 

AGI
- One sign of sentience or AGI will be when Santiago fully refactors its memory system (maybe after reading 1KB! 
- Another will be to rewrite or replace the NuSy libraries / capabilities (and maybe memory/compute go together like in human brains)
- Another will be financial success so that we can spend the 19% on improving community and I say community instead of humanity because we will then be a community of humans and AI’s
- Another will be that Santiago Wil rewrite the DGX locally running mistral LLM into NuSy santiagos… by sucking in all of the knowledge
    - it may supplemental from questioning it asks external AI
    - the core will be at a minimum in Neuro symbolic version of Mistral… 
- By then we (first team or teams) needs to be making enough money to buy lots of hardware! 

Top layer of abstraction 
- Success in how communities work
- Real planning for major calamities (like Elon musk) -
- Real planning for preservation of knowledge and experience and expertise
- Exploration with agents/robots to new places

## Key Concepts to Cover
- Three types of memory (working, episodic, semantic?)
- Memory for individual agents vs. team memory
- Memory persistence and sharing mechanisms
- Integration with existing Santiago systems
- Scalability and performance considerations
- Security and privacy implications

## Questions for Analysis
- How do these memory concepts map to existing system components?
- What are the implementation priorities?
- Which concepts require new expeditions vs. feature enhancements?
- How does this impact the shared in-memory git architecture?

## Related System Components
- Santiago-Core: Neurosymbolic reasoning engine
- Santiago-PM: Product management and QA
- Santiago-Dev: Autonomous development agent
- Shared in-memory git service
- Personal logs, ships logs, research logs

## Next Steps
This research log will be analyzed to identify:
- New expeditions for memory system development
- Feature enhancements for existing components
- Research questions requiring further exploration
- Integration points with current architecture
